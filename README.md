# Security

## Security policy for Reboot Games:

### Definition - What is a Security Policy?

A security policy is a written document in an organization or company outlining how to protect from threats, including computer security threats, and how to handle situations when/if they do occur. A security policy must identify all of a company's assets as well as all the potential threats to those assets. Company employees need to be kept updated on the company's security policies. The policies themselves should be updated regularly as well. Most policies are a running document where they are never finished due to the development of technology.

## Outline of business:
### Number of staff
Within Reboot games there are a number of personnel. Overall there are 15 employees. 1 main founder or CEO and then the other 14 are workers or employees whose role is to work on given projects and jobs. 
### Structure
As you can see from the image below it shows the way the hierarchy within the company works. You have the CEO on top in charge of all the workers. It is not the same as many common businesses where there are many different levels such as manager and senior worker. As reboot games is not a large company (only consisting of 15 people) there is no need to allocate other roles If not necessary.

### Hardware/software used:
Within reboot games, all workers work on the same spec pc with the exact same display and peripherals. The pc’s themselves consist of:
*	Intel i7 7700k CPU
*	Nvidia GTX 970 GPU
*	Intel Motherboard
*	1TB of internal storage as well as cloud storage provided by West Herts College.
*	16GB of DDR3 Ram

For the tasks required by Reboot games, these pc’s are adequate and work perfectly for all of the workers needs. In comparison to some systems used by other companies, these systems provided are high-spec and work better than needed.

Regarding the software used within reboot games. Each worker has their own preferred software to use for some tasks however I will name some of the more common software used by most if not all members:
*	Windows 10(operating system)
*	Google chrome
*	Microsoft word
*	Adobe photoshop
*	Visual Studio
*	Notepad and Notepad++

Some tasks require the use of multiple pieces of software to help us complete tasks however some simple tasks like documentation may only require Microsoft word. In regard to pricing for everything. The systems display and peripherals we use come to around £1400 per person or per system. The software we use we get for free due to be a part of West Herts College. The software would usually come to around £60 monthly or £680 annually.

#### Security hardware/software:

In regards to the security that we use whilst working. As we work within a college environment where the network is set up as a client-server all of our traffic and data goes through a central server which has a very strict firewall. Along side the tough firewall all the software and applications are kept up to date in order to maintain the latest level of protection possible. Another alternate to the systems we use could be the actual security within the college campus. There are security barriers which require us to have a valid ID on us at all times. On top of that, the room which we all work from within needs an ID card to gain access too. Only certain members of the college including ourselves have that access. 

This means that there is not only a level of software based security to help prevent any attacks or attempts at gaining any information, there is also the physical security like the barriers and the locked rooms on top of the security guards at the main entrance.

### Nature of work

Reboot Games is mainly project work for clients. The client would come to us with an idea or a concept in the form of a pitch and we would review their pitch, ask questions and decide if it is in the scope of our abilities. Usually the companies or clients that come and pitch ideas want to turn their idea into a game, application or business software. We have previously done work for ZSL where they asked us to create an education application in the form of a game. The application that they wanted was to be for young children/teenagers. Another client which we have recently just had a pitch from is a driving school who want to redesign and redevelop their excisting application. Another client which we are close to hearing a pitch from is a disaster recovery team that would like to turn their paper based process into a software based process. At Reboot games we have many different members which specialise in different fields and have different abilities which allow us to match to most tasks that we undertake.

## Risks to reboot games:
* Physical
* Data
* social Engineering

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Explanation | Danger | How To Prevent The Risk  |
| ---- | -----------  | ------------------ | -------- |
| Internal leaks | Information About The Company Leaked From Within | Low | Find Out Who Is The Leak
| Power Cut | All Power To The Building Goes Out| Medium | Save Back Ups 24/7, Transfer to back ups servers, switch to back up generators. |
| Theft | Someone Breaking In And Stealing Equipment | High | Making Sure All Doors Are Locked And Alarms Are Set, ensure security guards are always stationed at entrances. |
| Viruses | The PCs Get Malicious Software| High | Making Sure All Anti-Virus Software Is Updated, Ensure firewall is properly configured. |

### Different threats an organisation faces:
#### Viruses:
A computer virus is a form of malicious software that will modify other progrmas on a computer by inserting its own code into them. When this process is done the affect areas are said to be 'infected' with a computer virus. Within an organisation viruses are a constant risk to the computer systems. Viruses dont always have the intent of stealing data or information from a company. Sometimes viruses are used to cause damage to a companies systems or even to stop them from completing a task like trading. Viruses come in all shapes and sizes in todays technology so it is very important for companies to stay up to date with their security software.
#### Internal Leaks
Internal leaks are where an employee within a company has access too or knowledge of information that could be vital for another company and exposes or leaks that information to the public or to other outside sources. This often happens by accident as there are many ways information can accidently get out. One way that information could get out is a data breach from a hacker that has gained access to this information. Sometimes though it can actually be employee internally that release this information. Usually a lot of companies will try to solve this issue by having employees sign a non-disclosure form when joining the business. The non-disclosure form is there to keep the information of the company internal so as not to be shared. This means that the employee can’t leak any information that is not public knowledge. If the employee did leak any information then the company could take legal action against them.
#### Phishing
Phishing is where someone, usually a cyber-criminal will send you emails or messages that are trying to trick you into clicking on them. The main focus of these emails or messages are to get you to click on the links or download the attachments. This is a very common way of hackers gaining information from you online. If you investigate further you can usually tell it’s a phishing email if you look deeper into it unless it’s a professional looking one.
#### Power Cut
Power cuts can happen at any time and anywhere as they are very unpredictable. There are many causes of power cuts, whether it be an overload or surge from too many devices being plugged in or an actual power cut due to an issue at a power station or even weather can play a part. The main problem with power cuts are that they are unpredictable, so it is hard to prevent. A good way that a lot of businesses are preventing losing data from a power cut are by using backup generators or large-scale battery banks so that if the power goes out, people have enough time to save their work.
### Network Security
#### DMZ
A DMZ is a physical or a sub network that contains and exposes organisations external facing services to an untrusted network. A DMZ can be used to allow people to access a webpage which is being hosted on a network. An email server is an example of this where it allows different groups to access the same server. This can come from an internal or external source. DMZ can also provide an additional layer of security to and organisations local area network. The DMZ functions as a small, isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network and effectively allows the organization extra time to detect and address breaches before they would further penetrate into the internal network. 

If we was to add a DMZ into Reboot games it could be very helpful to us all as well as other companies as the servers will be available to be accessed safely to all sources. This would also not put the local area network in danger either. This can be very important for a company as it means that their personal server is still disconnected from the server clients are trying to access. DMZ adds another layer of security to the business and allows safer server management, as well as the event of an attack, it can be much safer as it will only affect the DMZ and not the full local area network.
#### Static IP
An IP is a number that is given to a computer or any device that connects to the internet. The internet service provider will assign this number to the device. This IP number is used to locate the device similar to a door number or address. A common problem though with IP addresses, is that if someone gains access to your IP address then it is like getting access to someone’s actual address. By gaining access to the IP, that person can see where you are and what data has been sent to that computer recently. The IP address is vital for computers to communicate with one another. The difference between a static IP and a network IP is that a Static IP will always stay with the device it is assigned to. However, a network IP will change with the network. Having a static IP address means that additional security measures can be added to that specific IP address which allows for a lot more configuration and security.
#### NAT
Network address translation is a method of giving a device within a private network a public address. This public address will be configures so that an additional layer of security is added. This is because of the new IP address, the internal IP is now hidden. Now when the network is accessed it will only access the public IP address and not the private one. This adds an extra layer of protection and security so that attacks that target IP addresses will target this new public one instead.
### Security procedures
Security procedures are all about how exactly companies and businesses keep their data and employees safe. Companies have lots of different ways of protecting their assets from outside threats whether it’s a physical threat or a virtual threat. At Reboot games there are multiple levels of protection to keep people out that are not supposed to be there or to gain access to information that they shouldn’t get. Some of the procedures at Reboot games consist off;
* ID Pass
* Logging into systems
* Locker doors
#### ID Pass (entering the building)
As Reboot games is held within West Herts college, there is security within to help with security. As soon as you enter the college campus there are security gates which stop anyone who doesn’t own a college ID from entering. Once you swipe your ID on the gate, it flashes green and opens to let you in. If someone forgets their college card, then they have to answer some question to be able to be allowed inside the inner campus. This is so that unwanted personnel cannot enter the college.
#### Logging in
When logging into a pc at the college, you need to enter in your unique password and username otherwise you cannot access any of your work. Each person’s user name is generated by the college and then you set your own password. These usernames and passwords allow you to access your work from any pc from within the college. This is because all the accounts are run off a central server. If someone does not have log in details, then they are not able to gain access to anything on these computers. Also, these computers have restricted privileges meaning that even students have limited access to what they can do.
#### Room Lock
Each classroom is locked by a magnetic lock as well as a traditional key lock. In order to gain access to each room you need to make sure the room has been unlocked by key. Between the hours of 8:30-20:00 the rooms are unlocked for use however the magnetic locks prevent access from just anyone during these times. Luckily at Reboot games we have been given permission through our key cards. This means that even if someone does make their way through the security barriers then they are met by the magnetic door locks.
### Data Protection
Data protection is a law where users data online has to be protected and cannot be used or gathered without the user’s consent. The data protection act prevents the misuse of customers data and also prevents businesses and organisations from using their data. An update has been made to the data protection act in 2017 which allows any user to back out of an agreement at any time and for their data to be deleted off their databases as a part of the new agreement. Every company has to agree with terms also if they do not they can face a big fine and lose a lot of reputation for their company. Whilst Reboot Games is working on a project or handling data it needs to be kept safe and should not be used for anything other than what was agreed upon.

### Impact of incorrect configuration of firewall policies and third party VPNs
#### VPN
A VPN is where you are given a public IP address to use on private networks. This keeps your private location and data secure. VPNs are used to allow safe transfer of data online usually when data is sent the packet would travel though public domains to be successfully transferred. However when using a VPN, it is on a private connection that involves two IPs connecting with one another privately. This means that when the two systems want to transfer files or data to each other, they can go through a private network rather than risking putting it on a public domain in which it could be seen and tracked. Companies use VPN’s regularly these days as it adds a layer of security by adding a false IP. This means that if they gain access to this IP it will only get to the VPN IP and not your network IP.

VPN’s do also have their downsides. They can for starters be expensive as you may need to pay someone or a company so they can provide the service for you. Another downside is that whoever owns the VPN can see the data which is transferred which can be an easy way of a data breach. Another drawback of VPN’s is that it uses IPs that they may have used before in the past. so someone may have done something to the IP and now it goes to your PC and if they do something it is now linked to your PC.
#### Firewall
A firewall is a form of software which decides what data or traffic passes through it. Firewalls can be adjusted to either loosen the amount or type of data going through or restrict it further. When data is getting sent to a firewall there are two options for that packet of data. 1. It gets passed through successfully and continues its journey or 2. It get blocked and instantly sent back to the sender.

If a firewall is incorrectly set up, then it means that data that is not intended to make its way through may be able too. This can of course pose a risk to everyone’s systems which are connected to the server where the firewall is installed. As an example, if someone is using a third-party VPN, their servers are usually public to anyone who signs into the service. This means if someone was to infect all the users and you have no firewall to protect you then your PC would get sent harmful virus and other dangerous malware.

### Disaster Recovery Plan
Usually all companies these days have recovery plans in place in the event of a disaster. The reason for this is so that if a business is hit by a disaster or a major problem, they would have a plan in place for every possible situation to ensure the damage to the business is minimal. These plans help businesses manage during these times when they may get hit so that no long term damage is done. There are different steps to help make sure that this process of recovery is quick and successful.
#### Recovery Process/ Recovery Time
The recovery process of a business can vary depending on the scale of the business. The company will usually start by prioritising clients and pieces of work depending on how important they are to the company. The most important jobs will be prioritised and given more protection due to the business relying on them. This step of prioritising what is most important is crucial to helping the business stay on top of the disaster.

The time in which a recovery takes to get back to normal working conditions again depends on the scale of the business. If the business relies on specific hardware to operate then it will focus on getting that back up and running first and quickly to try and resume normal operations. The longer the normal operations are down the more money the company is loosing. This can be measured in seconds, minutes, hours and days. Also if the downtime was not caused by a huge disaster but a failure in the system then the business will need to identify these flaws and improve them so that it does not happen again within the future.
