## Security

### Definition - What is a Security Policy?

A security policy is a written document in an organization or company outlining how to protect from threats, including computer security threats, and how to handle situations when/if they do occur.

A security policy must identify all of a company's assets as well as all the potential threats to those assets. Company employees need to be kept updated on the company's security policies. The policies themselves should be updated regularly as well. Most policies are a running document where they are never finished due to the development of technology.
