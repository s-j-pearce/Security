# Security

## Security policy for Reboot Games:

### Definition - What is a Security Policy?

A security policy is a written document in an organization or company outlining how to protect from threats, including computer security threats, and how to handle situations when/if they do occur. A security policy must identify all of a company's assets as well as all the potential threats to those assets. Company employees need to be kept updated on the company's security policies. The policies themselves should be updated regularly as well. Most policies are a running document where they are never finished due to the development of technology.

## Outline of business:
### Number of staff
Within Reboot games there are a number of personnel. Overall there are 15 employees. 1 main founder or CEO and then the other 14 are workers or employees whose role is to work on given projects and jobs. 
### Structure
As you can see from the image below it shows the way the hierarchy within the company works. You have the CEO on top in charge of all the workers. It is not the same as many common businesses where there are many different levels such as manager and senior worker. As reboot games is not a large company (only consisting of 15 people) there is no need to allocate other roles If not necessary.

### Hardware/software used:
Within reboot games, all workers work on the same spec pc with the exact same display and peripherals. The pc’s themselves consist of:
*	Intel i7 7700k CPU
*	Nvidia GTX 970 GPU
*	Intel Motherboard
*	1TB of internal storage as well as cloud storage provided by West Herts College.
*	16GB of DDR3 Ram

For the tasks required by Reboot games, these pc’s are adequate and work perfectly for all of the workers needs. In comparison to some systems used by other companies, these systems provided are high-spec and work better than needed.

Regarding the software used within reboot games. Each worker has their own preferred software to use for some tasks however I will name some of the more common software used by most if not all members:
*	Windows 10(operating system)
*	Google chrome
*	Microsoft word
*	Adobe photoshop
*	Visual Studio
*	Notepad and Notepad++

Some tasks require the use of multiple pieces of software to help us complete tasks however some simple tasks like documentation may only require Microsoft word. In regard to pricing for everything. The systems display and peripherals we use come to around £1400 per person or per system. The software we use we get for free due to be a part of West Herts College. The software would usually come to around £60 monthly or £680 annually.

#### Security hardware/software:

In regards to the security that we use whilst working. As we work within a college environment where the network is set up as a client-server all of our traffic and data goes through a central server which has a very strict firewall. Along side the tough firewall all the software and applications are kept up to date in order to maintain the latest level of protection possible. Another alternate to the systems we use could be the actual security within the college campus. There are security barriers which require us to have a valid ID on us at all times. On top of that, the room which we all work from within needs an ID card to gain access too. Only certain members of the college including ourselves have that access. 

This means that there is not only a level of software based security to help prevent any attacks or attempts at gaining any information, there is also the physical security like the barriers and the locked rooms on top of the security guards at the main entrance.

### Nature of work

Reboot Games is mainly project work for clients. The client would come to us with an idea or a concept in the form of a pitch and we would review their pitch, ask questions and decide if it is in the scope of our abilities. Usually the companies or clients that come and pitch ideas want to turn their idea into a game, application or business software. We have previously done work for ZSL where they asked us to create an education application in the form of a game. The application that they wanted was to be for young children/teenagers. Another client which we have recently just had a pitch from is a driving school who want to redesign and redevelop their excisting application. Another client which we are close to hearing a pitch from is a disaster recovery team that would like to turn their paper based process into a software based process. At Reboot games we have many different members which specialise in different fields and have different abilities which allow us to match to most tasks that we undertake.

###Different threats an organisation faces:
#### Viruses:
A computer virus is a form of malicious software that will modify other progrmas on a computer by inserting its own code into them. When this process is done the affect areas are said to be 'infected' with a computer virus. Within an organisation viruses are a constant risk to the computer systems. Viruses dont always have the intent of stealing data or information from a company. Sometimes viruses are used to cause damage to a companies systems or even to stop them from completing a task like trading. Viruses come in all shapes and sizes in todays technology so it is very important for companies to stay up to date with their security software.
